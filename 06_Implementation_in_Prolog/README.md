# Implementation in Prolog

While the rule clauses (rule.pl and defaults.pl) are general, the case-related clauses (individuals.pl and casefacts.pl) are based on the example cases which can be found in /08\_ReasoningVisualization/ExampleCases.

For each Prolog implementation, there exists a shell script test.sh for executing SWI-Prolog on the main program file program.pl. If the execution does not output anything, then the conjecture "is\_application\_legal(app1)" has been successfully proved.
